          <h3>Hello World</h3>
          <p>Iâ€™m mJordan, a creative front end developer currently working as a contractor at Nike. Nothing excites me more than immersing myself in a good challenge or a great book. For me, coding is the perfect mix of logical problem solving, and creative artistic expression. When not coding, I am spending my time creating something new, getting involved in the local tech community, or exploring the world around me with my trusty Nikon camera.</p>

        <p>I started attending meetups and meeting my coding community in Portland during the summer of 2015. I now volunteer with and organize meetups for PDXNode and Women Who Code Portland. I have spent time volunteering at other various meetups and always make sure to help out a new developer where I can.</p>

          <p>I joined the organizing team for this meetup in the first half of 2017. I help with organizing our two regular monthly events: a presentation night and a hack night. I also help out with community engagement via twitter, and have been reaching out to gather sponsors.</p>

          <p>I was brought on to the leadership team towards the end of 2016 officially. I spent the first several months helping at Networking Nights, and filling in as needed for other events. In 2018 I am stepping into a more regular role as the co-lead for the Open Source Study Nights that are held once a month. I will also be creating a set of four CSS based workshops that I will lead this year.</p>
